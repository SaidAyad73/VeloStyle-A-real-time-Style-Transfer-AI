# VeloStyle - Fast Neural Style Transfer with CLIP

## Project Overview

VeloStyle is a neural style transfer application that uses OpenAI's CLIP model combined with advanced loss functions to rapidly apply artistic styles to images using natural language descriptions. The project leverages directional CLIP loss, content preservation loss, total variation regularization, and patch-level consistency to achieve high-quality style transfer results.

**Key Features:**
- Fast style transfer training using CLIP embeddings
- Natural language style descriptions (e.g., "oil painting", "watercolor")
- Multiple training modes (individual images, dataset directories, inference)
- Real-time GUI with Streamlit
- Checkpoint support for model persistence
- Batch processing capabilities

---

## Project Architecture

The project follows a standard deep learning pipeline with 7 main phases:

### 1. Problem Definition and Data Collection
**Objective:** Define the neural style transfer problem and prepare image datasets.

**What it does:**
- Accepts user input images through the Streamlit GUI
- Supports both single image uploads and batch processing from directories
- Stores images in the `/data` directory for processing
- Allows flexible dataset scaling through the `scale_data` parameter

**Input Requirements:**
- Images in JPG, PNG format
- Any resolution (automatically resized to specified `img_size`: 256-1024px)
- Dataset can be single or multiple images

**Output:** Organized image dataset ready for preprocessing

---

### 2. Data Cleaning and Analysis

**Objective:** Prepare and curate high-quality image datasets, remove irrelevant images, and balance dataset representation.

**Why High-Resolution Images Matter:**
Our style transfer model relies on advanced loss functions that benefit significantly from high-resolution input images. Therefore, we use:
- **DIV2K Dataset:** ~800 high-quality diverse images (typically 2K resolution)
- **Flickr2K Dataset:** ~2,500 high-resolution images from Flickr (various artistic styles)

These datasets provide the image quality and detail needed for our CLIP-based loss functions to work effectively.

**The Challenge:**
However, during training we faced several issues:
- **Noisy/Messy Images:** Low-quality, corrupted, or irrelevant photos
- **Class Imbalance:** Too many images of one type (e.g., many landscapes, few portraits)
- **Unwanted Styles:** Images that don't match our target style domains

**Our Solution - Smart Filtering Using CLIP + K-Means Clustering:**

**Step 1: Extract Image Features with CLIP**
- Use CLIP's vision encoder to convert each image into a numerical "fingerprint" (512-dimensional vector)
- This fingerprint captures what the image is about (content, objects, style)

**Step 2: Identify Target Classes**
- Specify which image types we want (e.g., "persons", "landscapes", "sea")
- CLIP automatically filters images matching these descriptions
- This removes unwanted/messy images automatically

**Step 3: Balance Dataset Using K-Means Clustering**
- **Problem:** After filtering, we still have imbalance (many similar images, few diverse ones)
- **Solution:** Group similar images together using K-Means clustering on CLIP features
  - Cluster 1: All similar landscape photos → pick 50 representative images
  - Cluster 2: Different painting styles → pick 50 representative images
  - Cluster 3: Portrait variations → pick 50 representative images
- This ensures diversity across the dataset

**Processing Steps:**
```python
1. Load all images from DIV2K + Flickr2K
2. Extract CLIP embeddings for each image
3. Filter by class descriptions using CLIP
4. Apply K-Means clustering (typically 10-50 clusters)
5. Select balanced samples from each cluster
6. Final dataset: High-quality, balanced, diverse images

### 3. Feature Engineering

**Objective:** Extract meaningful features from images and text.

**What it does:**
- **CLIP Image Encoder:** Extracts image features using pre-trained OpenAI CLIP vision encoder
- **CLIP Text Encoder:** Converts style descriptions (e.g., "oil painting") into embedding space
- **VGG19 Content Encoder:** Extracts semantic content features for content preservation
- **Patch Extraction:** Creates overlapping patches for spatial consistency checking

**Key Components:**
- `clip_model`: `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` for image/text embeddings
- `vgg19`: Pre-trained VGG19 (layers 0-21) for content loss
- `processor`: CLIPProcessor for tokenization and image preprocessing
- `patch_transform`: Extracts N×N patches for patch-level consistency

**Output:** 
- Image feature embeddings (512-dim CLIP vectors)
- Text feature embeddings (512-dim for each style description)
- Content feature pyramids (multi-scale VGG features)
- Patch embeddings for spatial validation

### 4. Model Design

**Objective:** Design the neural style transfer architecture.

**Model Components:**

#### A. **Style Transfer Network** (Encoder-Decoder)
- **Downsampling Path:** Reduces spatial dimensions while increasing channels
  - `DownBlock`: Conv → InstanceNorm → ReLU (3×3 kernels)
  - Progressive resolution reduction with feature accumulation
  
- **Bottleneck:** Processes full resolution features
  
- **Upsampling Path:** Restores spatial dimensions with skip connections
  - `UpBlock`: Bilinear upsampling + concatenation + Conv
  - Skip connections from corresponding downsampling layers
  - Maintains fine details while applying style

#### B. **Loss Functions**

1. **DirectionalCLIPLoss** (`DirectionalCLIPLoss` class)
   - **Purpose:** Enforce style transfer through CLIP embedding space
   - **Mechanism:**
     - Computes directional difference: `diff = (style_embedding - photo_embedding)`
     - Aligns generated image features with style direction
     - Loss formula: `1 - cosine_similarity(generated_diff, style_diff)`
   - **Patch Loss:** Validates patch-level consistency with threshold filtering
   - **Parameters:** `threshold=0.7` (ignores low patch loss which could cause overfitting)

2. **ContentLoss** (`ContentLoss` class)
   - **Purpose:** Preserve original image content
   - **Mechanism:** 
     - Multi-scale VGG feature matching (4 encoder levels)
     - MSE between generated and original features at each level
     - Prevents excessive content destruction
   - **Formula:** `Σ ||VGG(generated) - VGG(original)||²`

3. **TotalVariationLoss** (`TotalVariationLoss` class)
   - **Purpose:** Reduce noise and artifacts
   - **Mechanism:** Penalizes high-frequency variations
   - **Formula:** `||∇ₓ image|| + ||∇ᵧ image||`

4. **Combined Loss** (`CLIPStylerLoss` class)
   ```
   Total Loss = λ_clip × clip_loss 
              + λ_patch × patch_loss 
              + λ_content × content_loss 
              + λ_tv × tv_loss
   ```
   **Tuning Parameters:**
   - `λ_clip` (500-2000): Style strength; higher = stronger style transfer
   - `λ_patch` (5000-20000): Spatial consistency; typically ~10× λ_clip
   - `λ_content` (50-300): Content preservation; higher = keep more original
   - `λ_tv` (0.001-0.1): Noise reduction; higher = smoother but less detail

**Architecture Diagram:**
```
Input Image (B, 3, H, W)
    ↓
[DownBlock 1] → 64 channels
    ↓
[DownBlock 2] → 128 channels
    ↓
[DownBlock 3] → 256 channels
    ↓
Bottleneck Features
    ↓
[UpBlock 3] → skip from DownBlock 3 → 128 channels
    ↓
[UpBlock 2] → skip from DownBlock 2 → 64 channels
    ↓
[UpBlock 1] → skip from DownBlock 1 → 3 channels (RGB)
    ↓
Output Image (B, 3, H, W) [0-255]
```
NOTE: you can adjust the number of blocks and channels as needed using depth paramter.
**Pre-trained Models Used:**
